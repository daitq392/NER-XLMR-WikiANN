# Named Entity Recognition with XLM-R and WikiANN

## Overview
This project fine-tunes **XLM-R (XLM-RoBERTa)** for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using the **WikiANN** dataset. The dataset is annotated with **LOC (Location), PER (Person), and ORG (Organization)** tags in **IOB2 format** , five languages are used to train the model: **English (en), Vietnamese (vi), French (fr), Dutch (nl), and Chinese (zh)**.
